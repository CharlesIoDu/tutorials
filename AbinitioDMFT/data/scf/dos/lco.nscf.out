     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  4

     Atomic positions and unit cell read from directory:
     /mnt/ceph/users/sbeck/QE_tmp/lco.save/
     Atomic positions from file used, from input discarded


     gamma-point specific algorithms are used
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead
